              <div>
                Canis Lupus: The wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the gray wolf or
                grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More
                than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray
                wolves, as popularly understood, comprise wild subspecies. The wolf is
                the largest extant member of the family Canidae. It is also
                distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and
                muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is
                nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as
                the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with
                them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray,
                and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all
                white.

            <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5">
              <h3>Diet</h3>
              <div>
                Like all land mammals that are pack hunters, the wolf feeds
                predominantly on wild herbivorous hoofed mammals that can be divided
                into large size 240–650 kg (530–1,430 lb) and medium size 23–130 kg
                (51–287 lb), and have a body mass similar to that of the combined mass
                of the pack members.[53][54] The wolf specializes in preying on the
                vulnerable individuals of large prey,[39] with a pack of 15 able to
                bring down an adult moose.[55] The variation in diet between wolves
                living on different continents is based on the variety of hoofed
                mammals and of available smaller and domesticated prey.[56] In North
                America, the wolf's diet is dominated by wild large hoofed mammals
                (ungulates) and medium-sized mammals. In Asia and Europe, their diet
                is dominated by wild medium-sized hoofed mammals and domestic species.
                The wolf depends on wild species, and if these are not readily
                available, as in Asia, the wolf is more reliant on domestic
                species.[56] Across Eurasia, wolves prey mostly on moose, red deer,
                roe deer and wild boar.[57] In North America, important range-wide
                prey are elk, moose, caribou, white-tailed deer and mule deer.[58]
                Wolves can digest their meal in a few hours and can feed several times
                in one day, making quick use of large quantities of meat.[59] A
                well-fed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, intestines,
                kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and
                winter.[60] Nonetheless, wolves are not fussy eaters. Smaller-sized
                animals that may supplement their diet include rodents, hares,
                insectivores and smaller carnivores. They frequently eat waterfowl and
                their eggs. When such foods are insufficient, they prey on lizards,
                snakes, frogs, and large insects when available.[61] Wolves in
                northern Minnesota prey on northern pike in freshwater streams.[62]
                The diet of coastal wolves in Alaska includes 20% salmon,[63] while
                those of coastal wolves in British Columbia includes 25% marine
                sources, and those on the nearby islands 75%.[64] In Europe, wolves
                eat apples, pears, figs, melons, berries and cherries. In North
                America, wolves eat blueberries and raspberries. Wolves also eat
                grass, which may provide some vitamins, but is most likely used mainly
                to induce vomiting to rid themselves of intestinal parasites or long
                guard hairs.[65] They are known to eat the berries of mountain-ash,
                lily of the valley, bilberries, cowberries, European black nightshade,
                grain crops, and the shoots of reeds.[61] In times of scarcity, wolves
                will readily eat carrion.[61] In Eurasian areas with dense human
                activity, many wolf populations are forced to subsist largely on
                livestock and garbage.[57] Prey in North America continue to occupy
                suitable habitats with low human density, the wolves eating livestock
                and garbage only in dire circumstances.[66] Cannibalism is not
                uncommon in wolves during harsh winters, when packs often attack weak
                or injured wolves and may eat the bodies of dead pack members

            <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5">
              <h3>Communication</h3>
              <div>
                Wolves communicate using vocalizations, body postures, scent, touch,
                and taste.[97] The phases of the moon have no effect on wolf
                vocalization, and despite popular belief, wolves do not howl at the
                moon.[98] Wolves howl to assemble the pack usually before and after
                hunts, to pass on an alarm particularly at a den site, to locate each
                other during a storm, while crossing unfamiliar territory, and to
                communicate across great distances.[99] Wolf howls can under certain
                conditions be heard over areas of up to 130 km2 (50 sq mi).[39] Other
                vocalizations include growls, barks and whines. Wolves do not bark as
                loudly or continuously as dogs do in confrontations, rather barking a
                few times and then retreating from a perceived danger.[100] Aggressive
                or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and
                deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while
                submissive ones carry their bodies low, flatten their fur, and lower
                their ears and tail.[101] Scent marking involves urine, feces, and
                anal gland scents. This is more effective at advertising territory
                than howling and is often used in combination with scratch marks.
                Wolves increase their rate of scent marking when they encounter the
                marks of wolves from other packs. Lone wolves will rarely mark, but
                newly bonded pairs will scent mark the most.[39] These marks are
                generally left every 240 m (260 yd) throughout the territory on
                regular travelways and junctions. Such markers can last for two to
                three weeks,[94] and are typically placed near rocks, boulders, trees,
                or the skeletons of large animals.[35] Raised leg urination is
                considered to be one of the most important forms of scent
                communication in the wolf, making up 60–80% of all scent marks
                observed.

                <strong>Interactions with other predators</strong>
                Wolves typically dominate other canid species in areas where they both
                occur. In North America, incidents of wolves killing coyotes are
                common, particularly in winter, when coyotes feed on wolf kills.
                Wolves may attack coyote den sites, digging out and killing their
                pups, though rarely eating them. There are no records of coyotes
                killing wolves, though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber
                them.[69] According to a press release by the U.S. Department of
                Agriculture in 1921, the infamous Custer Wolf relied on coyotes to
                accompany him and warn him of danger. Though they fed from his kills,
                he never allowed them to approach him.[70] Interactions have been
                observed in Eurasia between wolves and golden jackals, the latter's
                numbers being comparatively small in areas with high wolf
                densities.[35][69][71] Wolves also kill red, Arctic and corsac foxes,
                usually in disputes over carcasses, sometimes eating them.[35][72] A
                wolf, a bear, coyotes and ravens compete over a kill Brown bears
                typically dominate wolf packs in disputes over carcasses, while wolf
                packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites.
                Both species kill each other's young. Wolves eat the brown bears they
                kill, while brown bears seem to eat only young wolves.[73] Wolf
                interactions with American black bears are much rarer because of
                differences in habitat preferences. Wolves have been recorded on
                numerous occasions actively seeking out American black bears in their
                dens and killing them without eating them. Unlike brown bears,
                American black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over
                kills.[74] Wolves also dominate and sometimes kill wolverines, and
                will chase off those that attempt to scavenge from their kills.
                Wolverines escape from wolves in caves or up trees.[75] Wolves may
                interact and compete with felids, such as the Eurasian lynx, which may
                feed on smaller prey where wolves are present[76] and may be
                suppressed by large wolf populations.[77] Wolves encounter cougars
                along portions of the Rocky Mountains and adjacent mountain ranges.
                Wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting
                at different elevations for different prey (niche partitioning). In
                winter, when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys,
                interactions between the two species become more likely. Wolves in
                packs usually dominate cougars and can steal their kills or even kill
                them,[78] while one-to-one encounters tend to be dominated by the cat.
                There are several documented cases of cougars killing wolves.[79]
                Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution
                by dominating territory and prey opportunities and disrupting the
                feline's behaviour.[80] Wolf and Siberian tiger interactions are
                well-documented in the Russian Far East, where tigers significantly
                depress wolf numbers, sometimes to the point of localized extinction.
                Only human depletion of tiger numbers appears to protect wolves from
                competitive exclusion from them. With perhaps only four proven records
                of tigers killing wolves, these cases are rare; attacks appear to be
                competitive rather than predatory in nature.[81][76] In Israel,
                Central Asia and India wolves may encounter striped hyenas, usually in
                disputes over carcasses. Striped hyenas feed extensively on
                wolf-killed carcasses in areas where the two species interact.
                One-to-one, hyenas dominate wolves, and may prey on them,[82] but wolf
                packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas.[83][84] There is at
                least one case in Israel of a hyena associating and cooperating with a
                wolf pack. It is proposed that the hyena could benefit from the
                wolves' superior ability to hunt large, agile prey. The wolves could
                benefit from the hyena's superior sense of smell, to locate and dig
                out tortoises, to crack open large bones, and to tear open discarded
                food containers like tin cans

            <h3>Animal anatomy and biology</h3>
            <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5">
              Adult wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in length and 80–85 cm (31–33
              in) at shoulder height. The tail measures 29–50 cm (11–20 in) in length,
              the ears 90–110 mm (3 1⁄2– 43⁄8 in) in height, and the hind feet are
              220–250 mm (85⁄8–97⁄8 in). The size and weight of the modern wolf
              increases proportionally with latitude in accord with Bergmann's rule.
              The mean body mass of the wolf is 40 kg (88 lb), the smallest specimen
              recorded at 12 kg (26 lb) and the largest at 79.4 kg (175 lb).On
              average, European wolves weigh 38.5 kg (85 lb), North American wolves 36
              kg (79 lb), and Indian and Arabian wolves 25 kg (55 lb).Females in any
              given wolf population typically weigh 2.3–4.5 kg (5–10 lb) less than
              males. Wolves weighing over 54 kg (119 lb) are uncommon, though
              exceptionally large individuals have been recorded in Alaska and Canada.
              In central Russia, exceptionally large males can reach a weight of 69–79
              kg (152–174 lb).

              Pelage The wolf has very dense and fluffy winter fur, with a short
              undercoat and long, coarse guard hairs. Most of the undercoat and some
              guard hairs are shed in spring and grow back in autumn. The longest
              hairs occur on the back, particularly on the front quarters and neck.
              Especially long hairs grow on the shoulders and almost form a crest on
              the upper part of the neck. The hairs on the cheeks are elongated and
              form tufts. The ears are covered in short hairs and project from the
              fur. Short, elastic and closely adjacent hairs are present on the limbs
              from the elbows down to the calcaneal tendons.[ The winter fur is highly
              resistant to the cold. Wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably
              in open areas at −40 °C (−40 °F) by placing their muzzles between the
              rear legs and covering their faces with their tail. Wolf fur provides
              better insulation than dog fur and does not collect ice when warm breath
              is condensed against it.

              <h3>Facts</h3>
              <div>
                1.- Wolf is portrait multiple times in popular childrens books and
                usually as a bad image. 2.- Wolf pack size can range from 2 to 36
                wolves, with the average pack size consisting of 6 wolves. A pack
                usually consists of a breeding pair, their current offspring, and a
                few yearlings. There also may be a few related and/or unrelated adult
                wolves in the pack. 3.- It’s a common myth that wolves howl at the
                moon, or that the moon has anything to do with wolf communication.
                While wolves can and do howl at night, it is not directed at the moon
                and is to communicate with other pack members. 4.- Newborn wolf pups
                weigh about 1 pound when they are born and are brown in color. They
                don’t get their final adult coloration until much later.

              <h3>Behaviour</h3>
              <div>
                THE BOND Living in a pack not only facilitates the raising and feeding
                of pups, coordinated and collaborative hunting, and the defense of
                territory, it also allows for the formation of many unique emotional
                bonds between pack members, the foundation for cooperative living.
                Wolves care for each other as individuals. They form friendships and
                nurture their own sick and injured. Pack structure enables
                communication, the education of the young and the transfer of
                knowledge across generations. Wolves and other highly social animals
                have and pass on what can be best described as culture. A family group
                can persevere for several generations, even decades, carrying
                knowledge and information through the years, from generation to
                generation. Wolves play together into old age, they raise their young
                as a group, and they care for injured companions. When they lose a
                pack mate, there is evidence that they suffer and mourn that loss.
                When we look at wolves, we are looking at tribes—extended families,
                each with its own homeland, history, knowledge, and indeed, culture.
